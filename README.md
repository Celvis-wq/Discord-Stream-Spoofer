Discord Stream Spoofer
Made By: Celvis#1772

A fun thing to trick people. I personally like to rick roll cause I'm retarded.

PLEASE: Do not steal my stuff and claim it as yours, your free to use this but do not change any credits. Just use the tool. Yes you can modify the stream display itself.
Ex:
await client.change_presence(activity = discord.Streaming(name = "Stream spoofer - Celvis#1772" , url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sk25VISwSfk"))
                                                                  ^ Put whatever title you want, this is just the default | ^ Put whatever link you want it to redirect to.
